## **1.Project Overview**  

This project analyzes the **OCD Patient Dataset**, which contains detailed demographic and clinical information for **1,500 individuals diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**. The goal is to **explore, clean, and analyze** the dataset to uncover patterns in demographics, symptom severity, co-occurring conditions, and treatment approaches.

By performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, visualizations, and statistical assessments, this project provides meaningful insights into:

- The **age, gender, and ethnicity distribution** of OCD patients.

- The **duration and severity of symptoms**, measured using **Y-BOCS (Yale‑Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale)**.

- The **relationship between demographics and clinical outcomes** (e.g., how age, gender, or marital status relates to symptom severity).

- **Common previous diagnoses** (e.g., depression, PTSD) and their correlation with OCD symptoms.

- **Medications and treatment patterns** across different patient groups.

This analysis will help clinicians, researchers, and data enthusiasts better understand **OCD trends** in a diverse population and can guide further **predictive modeling** or **clinical decision-support systems.**

## **2. Objective**
 The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing demographic and clinical data of OCD patients. The analysis will focus on
 understanding the relationships between various demographic factors and clinical outcomes.

## **3. Dataset Description**  
 The dataset includes the following columns:  
 ● **Patient ID:** Unique identifier for each patient.  
 ● **Age:** Age of the patient.  
 ● **Gender:** Gender of the patient.  
 ● **Ethnicity:** Ethnicity of the patient.  
 ● **Marital Status:** Marital status of the patient.  
 ● **Education Level:** Level of education attained by the patient.  
 ● **OCD Diagnosis Date:** Date when OCD was diagnosed.  
 ● **Duration of Symptoms (months):** Duration for which the patient has been experiencing symptoms.  
 ● **Previous Diagnoses:** Any previous diagnoses before OCD.  
 ● **Family History of OCD:** Whether the patient has a family history of OCD.  
 ● **Obsession Type:** Type of obsessions experienced by the patient.  
 ● **Compulsion Type:** Type of compulsions experienced by the patient.  
 ● **Y-BOCS Score (Obsessions):** Y-BOCS score related to obsessions.  
 ● **Y-BOCS Score (Compulsions):** Y-BOCS score related to compulsions.  
 ● **Depression Diagnosis:** Whether the patient has been diagnosed with depression.  
 ● **Anxiety Diagnosis:** Whether the patient has been diagnosed with anxiety.  
 ● **Medications:** Medications the patient is currently taking.
